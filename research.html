                       and evaluating patient perception of the secure email program (e.g., usability, acceptability, experience of care). 
                       I have helped design planned interviews, will lead on conducting those interviews, and will lead on analysis of resulting

                        Research Study</h2>
                      <p class="blog-post-meta text-start right-indent"> June 2022 </p>

                     <p>  This project is examining the design, development, and evaluation of a highly-personalizable mobile app for 
                       self-tracking of symptoms, potential contributors, and treatments by patients with migraine. In collaboration with the 
                       University of Washington Headache Clinic, the team's prior research has found that many self-tracking applications
                       emphasize detailed data collection but fail to account for how data is likely to be used by a patient or their provider. 
                       This commonly results in high burdens of tracking irrelevant data that can lead to low engagement or abandonment, 
                       but can also lead to breakdowns when tracked data does correspond to the goals of a patient or their provider. The team 
                       has proposed a design strategy for self-tracking applications that explicitly represents patient and provider goals for 
                       self-tracking data, using that representation to scaffold appropriate choices in what data to track and how to analyze 
                       and visualize collected data</p>

                        Syndrome and Depression Collaboration with UW Nursing School</h2>
                      <p class="blog-post-meta text-start right-indent"> Jan 2022</p>

                     <p> This project is addressing the design of a mobile app for supporting an evidence-based self-management intervention 
                       in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and depression. In collaboration with a team from the University of Washington 
                       School of Nursing, I led on analyzing data from 8 interviews of patients in a pilot study of the app. The team had designed 
                       and developed the app, then found low usability and engagement in their pilot deployment, but were unsure how to attribute 
                       those findings. My interview analyses identified a mismatch in assumptions about patient experiences with their irritable 
                       bowel syndrome, wherein the app design assumed an individual was new to the self-management intervention but patient 
                       participants already had significant experience managing their irritable bowel syndrome. Patient participants therefore did 
                       not engage the intervention because they found the technology support inflexible with regard to variability in existing 
                       individual understanding of the intervention. Based on these results, we intend to conduct follow-up interviews and design 
                       sessions to examine how patients could adapt such an intervention to their existing personalized understanding. We then also 
                       intend to prepare a manuscript based on this re-design process.

                     <p>This project is addressing the design, development, and evaluation of a novel platform for technology-enhanced collaborative 
                       care in patients with cancer and depression, currently deployed in 5 urban and rural cancer centers. In collaboration with

                       the UW Scope platform combines a web-based provider registry with a patient mobile application. The design of this platform 
                       is based in part on the team's prior research on breakdowns in co-occurring cancer and depression, which also informed 
                       development of the parallel journeys framework for understanding and designing for multiple patient journeys associated with 
                       co-morbid conditions.

                     <p> As part of my Master's degree at Kennesaw State University, I led a collaboration between the Kennesaw State University 
                       BrainLab, the United in Gaming platform, and the Kennesaw State University Esports program. The project examined mental 
                       wellbeing in gamers playing social games amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. I hypothesized that, within gaming skill levels, 
                       player gaming motivation would correlate with player wellbeing. I led data collection and analysis combining pre and post 
                       gameplay collection of the Scale of Positive and Negative Experiences, post gameplay collection of the Player Experience 
                       and Need Satisfaction Scale, and facial expression analysis data obtained from video recording during gameplay.

                     <p>I completed my research and paper: “Using NeuroIS Tools to Understand How Individual Characteristics Relate
                       to Cognitive Behaviors of Students” coauthored with <a href="http://adrianerandolph.com" class="link-light">Dr. Adriane B. Randolph</a>, 
                       <a href="https://linenbkj.wixsite.com/kimcortesresearchgrp" class="link-light">Dr. Kimberly Cortes</a>, and
                       <a href="https://r.umn.edu/learning-research-and-innovation/faculty/Terrell" class="link-light">Dr. Cassidy Terrell</a>. 
                       Our paper was accepted into the Information Systems and Neuroscience. I also presented my findings at the NeuroIS Retreat 2020.</p>
