	My dissertation aims to provide personalized feedback and tailored recommendations to the collaborating researcher based on participant data, 
	with the goal of improving engagement in Health HCI research. Recommendations will be organized into three groups: researchers, institutions, and the 
	broader Health HCI field—with a central focus on making studies more accessible through universal design and appropriate accommodations, while 
	emphasizing ways to minimize harm to researchers by addressing emotional strain and advocating for better support systems. Findings 
	will be analyzed through three lenses: individual participant factors (e.g., beliefs, health literacy), societal influences (e.g., norms, 
	policies), and organizational characteristics (e.g., institutional practices). Grounded in participants’ lived experiences, the resulting 
	insights will guide more inclusive, empathetic, and effective research practices across the Health HCI community.

	This study endeavors to systematically identify and categorize the barriers encountered by participants in engaging with health research.

	<div class="publication-abstract">
	This project examined how Health HCI researchers approached participant engagement in studies involving patient-generated data, 
	long-term participation and collaborations with healthcare providers. Through interviews with researchers at various career stages, 
	I found that it was perceived that academic and industry priorities shaped engagement strategies differently—academia often prioritizing publishable data,
	while industry focused on user experience. These differing goals influenced who was included in studies and how participants were 
	engaged. Participants described how Mentorship, hands-on experience, and even tools like AI helped them navigate these challenges, while creative 
	approaches such as social media and livestreaming could offer new ways to build transparency and rapport. However, many cited institutional pressures often 
	limited deep engagement, leading researchers to call for improved training, alternative dissemination methods, and mentorship programs 
	to support more inclusive practices. Across the field, researchers emphasized the importance of early communication, human-centered design,
	and trust-building, and advocated for cultural shifts through peer mentorship, workshops, and shared resources. Overall, the project highlighted
	the need to realign systems and values in Health HCI to better support meaningful, participant-informed research.

	<div class="publication-abstract">
	This project is examining the design, development, and evaluation of a highly-personalizable mobile app for self-tracking of 
	symptoms, potential contributors, and treatments by patients with migraine. In collaboration with the University of Washington 
	Migraine Clinic, the team's prior research has found that many self-tracking applications emphasize detailed data collection 
	but fail to account for how data is likely to be used by a patient or their provider. This commonly results in high burdens of 
	tracking irrelevant data that can lead to low engagement or abandonment, but can also lead to breakdowns when tracked data does
	not correspond to the goals of a patient or their provider. The team proposed a design strategy for self-tracking applications that
	explicitly represents patient and provider goals for self-tracking data, using that representation to scaffold appropriate choices in what data to track and how to analyze 
        and visualize collected data.

	This project is addressing the design of a mobile app for supporting an evidence-based self-management intervention in patients 
	with irritable bowel syndrome and depression. In collaboration with a team from the University of Washington School of Nursing, 
	I led an analysis of data from eight patient interviews in a pilot study of the app. The team had designed and developed the app, 
	then found low usability and engagement in their pilot deployment, but were unsure how to attribute those findings. My interview
	analyses identified a mismatch in assumptions about patient experiences with their irritable bowel syndrome, wherein the app 
	design assumed an individual was new to the self-management intervention. Still, patient participants already had significant 
	experience managing their irritable bowel syndrome. Patient participants, therefore, did not engage in the intervention because they 
	found the technology support inflexible concerning variability in existing individual understanding of the intervention. Based on these results, we intend to conduct follow-up interviews and design 
        sessions to examine how patients could adapt such an intervention to their existing personalized understanding. We also 
        intend to prepare a manuscript based on this redesign process.

	This project is addressing the design, development, and evaluation of a novel platform for technology-enhanced collaborative 
       care in patients with cancer and depression, currently deployed in 5 urban and rural cancer centers. In collaboration with 
       a multidisciplinary team from the University of Washington Department of Psychiatry and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, 
       the UW Scope platform combines a web-based provider registry with a patient mobile application. The design of this platform 
        is based in part on the team's prior research on breakdowns in co-occurring cancer and depression, which also informed the 
       development of the parallel journeys framework for understanding and designing for multiple patient journeys associated with 
        co-morbid conditions.

	As part of my Master's degree at Kennesaw State University, I led a collaboration between the Kennesaw State University 
        BrainLab, the United in Gaming platform, and the Kennesaw State University Esports program. The project examined mental 
        well-being in gamers playing social games amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. I hypothesized that, within gaming skill levels, 
        player gaming motivation would correlate with player well-being. I led data collection and analysis, combining pre- and post-gameplay 
	collection of the Scale of Positive and Negative Experiences, post-gameplay collection of the Player Experience 
        and Need Satisfaction Scale, and facial expression analysis data obtained from video recording during gameplay.
