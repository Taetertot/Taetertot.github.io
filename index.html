                      <b>Abstract:</b>
                      <br>Collaborative care management is an evidence-based approach to integrated psychosocial care for patients with comorbid cancer and depression. Prior work highlights 
		      challenges in patient-provider collaboration in navigating parallel cancer care and psychosocial care journeys of these patients. We design and deploy SCOPE, a 
		      platform for technology-enhanced collaborative care combining a patient-facing mobile app with a provider-facing registry. We examine SCOPE through a total of 45 
		      interviews with patients and providers conducted in SCOPE's 15 months of design and development and 24 Months of SCOPE's deployment for actual care in 6 cancer 
		      clinics. We find that: (1) SCOPE supported patient engagement in its underlying collaborative care and behavioral activation interventions, (2) patient-generated 
		      data in SCOPE improved patient-provider collaboration between and within in-person sessions, (3) SCOPE supported providers in delivering care and improved care 
		      team collaboration, (4) experience with SCOPE created evolving expectations for collaboration around data, and (5) SCOPE's deployment in actual care surfaced 
		      important implementation barriers. We discuss the implications of our findings in terms of designing for engagement with behavioral health interventions, 
		      negotiating patient data sharing and provider responsiveness, supporting personalized self-tracking goals in evidence-based interventions, exploring the role of 
		     digital health navigators in technology-enhanced care, and the need for flexibility in aligning technology-supported interventions to patient needs.

                      <b>Abstract:</b>
                      <br>Research success in Health Human-Computer Interaction (Health HCI) often hinges on effective participant engagement. However, the definition and measurement of engagement 
		      can vary significantly depending on the context of the specific study. This variation necessitates using different methods and strategies to address issues related to low 
		      participation. This paper explores the perceptions of Health HCI researchers regarding the challenges they encounter in facilitating participant engagement and achieving 
		      meaningful research impact. Through semi-structured interviews with junior and more senior researchers, we examine insights into their experiences and the barriers they 
		      encounter. Our findings highlight a relationship between intended research contributions and researcher focus on engagement, a distinction between probe and product mindsets 
		      in Health HCI research, and complexities surrounding researcher well-being as they strive for compelling health research contributions. We also discuss implications for 
		      individual researchers, institutions, and the broader field of Health HCI, aiming to enhance the overall quality and relevance of research outcomes.

                      <b>Abstract:</b>
                      <br>Self-tracking and personal informatics offer important potential in chronic condition management, but such potential is often undermined by difficulty in aligning 
		      self-tracking tools to an individual’s goals. Informed by prior proposals of goal-directed tracking, we designed and developed MigraineTracker, a prototype app that 
		      emphasizes explicit expression of goals for migraine-related self-tracking. We then examined migraine patient experiences in a deployment study for an average of 12+ 
		      months, including a total of 50 interview sessions with 10 patients working with 3 different clinicians. Patients were able to express multiple types of goals, evolve 
		      their goals over time, align tracking to their goals, personalize their tracking, reflect in the context of their goals, and gain insights that enabled understanding, 
		      communication, and action. We discuss how these results highlight the importance of accounting for distinct and concurrent goals in personal informatics together with 
		      implications for the design of future goal-directed personal informatics tools.

                      <b>Abstract:</b>
                      <br>We examine the impact that gaming on a social tournament platform while playing multiplayer games has on the mental well-being of college 
                      students. In this early-stage study, we used the Scale of Positive and Negative Experiences and the Player Experience and Need Satisfaction 
                      Scale to measure well-being, gaming motivation, and enjoyment. We complement these survey tools with facial expression analysis of students 
                      during gameplay for a more holistic understanding of their emotional states and the impact of social gaming.

                      <b>Abstract:</b>
                      <br>The UW SCOPE study (Supporting Collaborative Care to Optimize Psychosocial Engagement in the Cancer Setting) is designing and developing a 
                      new web-based patient-provider platform for technology-enhanced Collaborative Care Management of depression in urban and rural cancer centers. 
                      The platform is currently deployed as part of a pragmatic effectiveness-implementation trial of technology-enhanced Collaborative Care vs. 
                      Usual Collaborative Care. This position paper for the CHI 2023 Workshop on Bridging HCI and Implementation Science introduces our setting 
                      of patients with cancer and depression, reviews our human-centered design of SCOPE, and reflects on our experiences with SCOPE as a case 
                      study at the intersection of human-centered design and implementation science.

                      <b>Abstract:</b>
                      <br>NeuroIS tools have increasingly been used to examine cognitive behaviors in educational settings. Here we present results of ongoing 
                      work applying neurophysiological tools to examine the cognitive load of student learners in the context of chemistry education. In 
                      particular, we investigate how individual characteristics relate to the Pope Engagement Index for students interacting with an 
                      information system for visualizing molecules. Characteristics such as meditation, levels of athleticism, and medication affecting 
                      alertness was found to significantly and positively correlate with cognitive load.
